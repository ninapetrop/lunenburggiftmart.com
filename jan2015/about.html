    <h3>Our History & Our Mission</h3>
    <p>The Lunenburg Giftmart was created in 2009 because of an identified need in our own community.  Due to a lagging economy we all find ourselves facing choices on where our money will go.  However, there are some families who have no resources for traditions such as gift giving during the holiday season.  Through the generosity of our community we have been able to offer a way for families in need to "shop" for free.
    <br>
    <br>    
The PTO works in conjunction with the Lunenburg Lions club to sponsor Giftmart and together has been able to help over 50 families each year and we hope to help even more this year.  It has been our understanding that the families visiting Giftmart have hit a rough patch due to job loss or illness and are both grateful and overwhelmed by the help of strangers. 
</p>
    
    <h3>Growing Every Year</h3>    
    <p>Since 2009 the number of families invited to Giftmart has steadily grown. In 2014 Giftmart opened it's doors to over 100 families, surpassing the prior year's attendance count of 80. We look towards 2015 with eagerness to provide a merry holiday season to even more families and celebrate our beloved community.</p>
