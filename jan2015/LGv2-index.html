                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Lunenburg Giftmart was created in 2009 because of an identified need in our own community.<br><br>Through the generosity of our sponsors and community members we have been able to offer a way for families in our community to “shop” for free during the holiday season.</p>

                <h3>How we Work</h3>
                <p>Lunenburg Giftmart works in conjuction with the Lunenburg Lions club and a number of community sponsors that provide both monetary and physical gift donations. Each year invitations to Giftmart are distributed through the Lunenburg school system and Lunenburg Boys and Girls Club.<br><br>
                Collection boxes for donated gifts are located at various locations across Lunenburg throughout the year. For a complete list of donation locations please click here. Monetary donations are also used to purchase gifts for Giftmart invitees.<br><br>
